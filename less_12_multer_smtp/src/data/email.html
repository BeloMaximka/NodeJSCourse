        <div class="email-body">
            <p>Dear <strong>Esteemed Beneficiary</strong>,</p>
            <p>
                I hope this email finds you well, though I‚Äôm sure you had no idea an ancient Ethiopian king was about to make your wildest dreams come true!
                Yes, you read that right. I, <strong>His Royal Highness King Abay III of Ethiopia</strong>, ruler of gold-plated palaces and savannahs filled with riches, 
                have handpicked <strong>YOU</strong> for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why, you ask? Well, you‚Äôre obviously a person of extreme importance, based solely on the fact that I found your email address on the 
                "<em>Internet of Magical Randomness</em>."
            </p>
            <p>
                Now, to the point. I urgently need to transfer <strong>$50 MILLION</strong> (yes, that‚Äôs <strong>MILLION</strong> with a capital M) out of my kingdom, 
                and I have chosen <strong>YOU</strong> (because my 500 trusted advisors are, uh... busy). 
                All I need is your bank account information, social security number, your dog‚Äôs maiden name, and your favorite pizza topping. 
                You know, the usual stuff kings ask for.
            </p>
            <p>
                In exchange for this simple favor, I am more than happy to offer you a <strong>10% reward</strong> ‚Äì a staggering <strong>$5 million</strong>! 
                That‚Äôs enough money to buy a small island, a fleet of llamas, or 3,000 gold-plated fidget spinners (if that‚Äôs your thing).
            </p>
            <p>
                Please act swiftly, as time is of the essence! The fate of my royal treasure rests in your capable hands, 
                oh <strong>Wise and Trustworthy Stranger</strong>. Surely, you can‚Äôt resist being part of this historical transfer of wealth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kindly reply with your details immediately (before I ask someone else‚Ä¶ but I totally won‚Äôt).
            </p>

            <p>Yours in extreme royal sincerity,</p>
