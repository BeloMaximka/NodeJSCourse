<h1>A Place That Almost Makes Sense</h1>
<p>I made this website. I think. For a reason… I thought I knew, but now I don’t. It’s something—something important, or
    maybe it’s just nothing, but either way it’s here now, and I can’t let it go. It’s like when you try to catch
    something in the dark, and you think you’ve got it, but it slips away before you can even look.
</p>
<p>I thought maybe this would make things clearer. Or less clear. Maybe it’s not for clarity. It’s not for anyone but
    me—or
    maybe it’s for you too, if you’re here. But I don’t know why you’re here. Are you? Is anyone? Sometimes I think I
    hear
    people reading, but it’s hard to tell if that’s real.
</p>

<p>
    There’s food here. Ideas. Stories. Or maybe just broken pieces of them, like fragments. I’m trying to fit them
    together, but they keep changing. You’ll see that, if you stay long enough. Things change here. The words don’t
    always stay still. Sometimes they move when I’m not looking, and I wonder if I wrote them at all.

</p>
<p>But this is the website. I’m not sure what it is. I’m not sure why. But it’s here. I think. Maybe.</p>
