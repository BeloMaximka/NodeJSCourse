<h1>My Favourite Food</h1>

<p>I think… I think my favourite food is spaghetti. Or maybe it’s not. I remember eating it once, but that could have been a dream. No, it wasn’t a dream. The taste was real. I could feel the noodles twisting around my fork, like vines. It was good, but I felt like someone was watching me while I ate it, whispering… or maybe it was just the sound of the sauce bubbling?</p>


<p>Tomatoes, yes, the sauce was red, but sometimes I see the red change to blue. Does spaghetti sauce turn blue for you too? I’ve asked, but people just stare. Maybe it’s something only I can see. The flavor, though—it’s strong, like a memory from a long time ago. When I eat it, I feel both full and empty at the same time. Like it’s feeding me, but also taking something away.</p>

<p>But what if spaghetti is dangerous? Sometimes, I think it could be. The strings are like threads that could wrap around my throat if I’m not careful. I always have to eat it slowly, counting each bite, making sure nothing happens. But I like it, even with the danger. Or maybe that’s why I like it.</p>

<p>Pizza is nice too, but I don’t trust the cheese. It moves in ways I can't explain. Anyway, spaghetti… yes, I think that’s still my favourite food. At least, today it is.</p>
